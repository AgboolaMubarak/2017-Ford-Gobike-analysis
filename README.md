## Dataset

> The dataset, 2017-fordgobike-tripdata.csv, is downloaded from Ford GoBike and licensed by Ford GoBike. This dataset includes 519,700 trips with 13 features such as locations, time, and user type. There are start and end stations.
The dataset provided to us by Ford include the following fields:

>  * Trip Duration (in seconds)
>  * Start Time and Date
>  * End Time and Date
>  * Start Station ID
>  * Start Station Name
>  * Start Station Latitude
>  * Start Station Longitude
>  * End Station ID
>  * End Station Name
>  * End Station Latitude
>  * End Station Longitude
>  * Bike ID
>  * User Type (Subscriber or Customer - "Subscriber" = Member or "Customer" = Casual)


## Summary of Findings

> We studied how long a user can spend on a trip based on the usertype, starting place, endpoint, time of day, month, and day of the week. A few observations were made on the association of each aspect of the datasets compared to the duration of each trip. We found that, depending on the majority of these features, we will be able to define how long a ride will last for a particular user. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The busiest stations are in San Francisco and connect to public transportation such as Caltrain and Ferry. The number of trips in each location and time period is heavily influenced by user types. Customers can expect more trips on weekends and in July. They also offer longer journeys. Subscribers, on the other hand, have more trips on weekends and ride evenly throughout the year.
